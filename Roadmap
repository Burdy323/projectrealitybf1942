Initial release*
0.2 release^

1)* Implementation of vehicle sights (Spandaxe has some sights he's working on - lets keep in touch)

1a)* Adjust stationary MG sights so that you default to a look down the sights view (instead of the current view that requires crosshairs). Also, lower every tanks top MG's so its more like Forgotten Hope's Tank MG's. Also do this for the stationary MG so the player model is a kneel'd down soldier and not a standing up man like vanilla

2)* Recoil, Deviation, Damage changes for all weapons/vehicles (look into how Forgotten Hope does it - Large Crosshair expantion as the player moves - then shrinks as player stops)

3)^ Importation of Weapon Models from Forgotten Hope 

3a)^ Importation of Vehicle Models from Forgotten Hope 

4)^ Sound/FX Rehaul (Use other mods - Forgotten Hope has nice FX all around)

5)^ Death bubbles on planes for all non pilot kits

6)^ Ticket bleeds higher for vehicles (Like PR assets)

7)^ 6th Class implementation - have this class be Engineers for land-centric maps, and pilots for air-centric maps

8)^ Kit limitations (Look into how FinnWars does it. This will be important for Engineer and Pilot kit implimentation, as well as balancing out special kits for balance)

9)^ Kit spawning at base. What kits would spawn would vary map to map - mainly be special kits such as sniper kits and pilots on land-centric maps

9a)^ One of these specials be a mortar kit - that has a rifle and a deployable mortar

9b)* To compliment this feature above, add supply trucks (or allow halftracks to resupply)

10)^ Continue adding custom maps as well as maps made within our community. Focus on finding large, realistic, and well-designed maps. need larger maps mainly.

11)* Slower soldier run speed. Will help make the maps seem larger

12)* LOD and Viewdistance changes - on a per map basis.

13)* Longer vehicle spawn times - on a per map basis (as some maps will need shorter vehicle spawn times for transportation assets to make up for the large map sizes).

14)* Force players to walk to different vehicle positions on larger vehicles (battleship, carrier) instead of "teleporting" to the new position.

15)^ Warmup time on vehicles before they start (plane rotors, boat propellers).

16)* Realistic time between firing rounds in a tank (around 15 rounds a minute, or 1 every 4 seconds(based on 75mm AT rounds)).

16a)* Amount of ammunition a tank can hold. E.g. Panthers could hold around 30 shells especially with all the casings laying around in the way.

16b)^ Weapon firing cooldown on all turrets.

17) Locked planes that are spawnable. Like the Subs/vehicles in BF4

18) Map icons (serverinfo ones). Have it so the icons indicate the size of the map.

19) MAYBE : Remove other ally characters on the mini map. Remove ingame text chat
