--------------------------------------------------------ROADMAP FOR FUTURE RELEASES--------------------------------------------------------
1) Implementation of vehicle sights (Spandaxe has some sights he's working on - lets keep in touch)

2) Recoil, Deviation, Damage changes for all weapons/vehicles (look into how Forgotten Hope does it - Large Crosshair expantion as the player moves - then shrinks as player stops)

3) Importation of Weapon Models from Forgotten Hope 

4) Sound/FX Rehaul (Use other mods - Forgotten Hope has nice FX all around)

5) Death bubbles on planes for all non pilot kits

6) Ticket bleeds higher for vehicles (Like PR assets)

7) 6th Class implementation - have this class be Engineers for land-centric maps, and pilots for air-centric maps

8) Kit limitations (Look into how FinnWars does it. This will be important for Engineer and Pilot kit implimentation, as well as balancing out special kits for balance)

9) Kit spawning at base. What kits would spawn would vary map to map - mainly be special kits such as sniper kits and pilots on land-centric maps

10) Continue adding custom maps as well as maps made within our community. Focus on finding large, realistic, and well-designed maps. need larger maps mainly.

11) Slower soldier run speed. Will help make the maps seem larger

12) LOD and Viewdistance changes - on a per map basis.

13) Longer vehicle spawn times - on a per map basis (as some maps will need shorter vehicle spawn times for transportation assets to make up for the large map sizes).
